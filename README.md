# Red

An extension with rich support for the [Red language](https://www.red-lang.org/), with features including the following and more:

* hint all syntax errors
* auto completion
* hover
* Interpret or compile Red source file

## Quick Start

* Install the extension
* Install [Red](http://www.red-lang.org/p/download.html) (Note: For Windows user, need to run ```red.exe --cli```)

  You're ready to use it.

* Turn off the Auto Completion

  You can turn off the autocompletion in the **User or Workspace Settings file (settings.json)** as follows.

  ```
  "red.autocomplete": false
  ```

## Compile Red Source File

For compiling Red source file, you need to configure the path to the Red toolchain in the **User or Workspace Settings file (settings.json)** as follows.

* Specify the full path of the red toolchain

  ```
  "red.redPath": "/home/user1/tools/red-latest"
  ```


You can also configure the directory for output files of the compiler. The current work space (project) directory is used by default.

(**Note**: If no work space directory, the output files are in the same folder as the Red source file.)

* Specify the full path

  ```
  "red.buildDir": "/home/user1/debug"
  ```


If you are using Linux and prefer to use the Windows version of Red through Wine until GUI support is available for Linux, you can point `red.redPath` to a small [shell script](https://github.com/red/red/wiki/Visual-Studio-Code-Plugin#running-red-through-wine-on-linux).
